# Project Proposal

**Title: FinishIt**

## What and Why?

Everyone, from students to professionals and beyond, have a hard time keeping their lives organized. FinishIt would be a supercharged to-do system to help these people stay on top of their tasks. With the ability of recommending a task for a user to complete at any given time, this app could help bust procrastination and allow users to be more organized and productive.

## For Whom?

This project is made for everyone, but specifically, students and professionals that are having a hard time keeping track of all the work that needs to get done. From the classroom or the office to your home, this app would allow users to get their lives in order.

## How?

FinishIt would allow users to add tasks, and also to add metadata to these tasks. Examples of task metadata could be a due date, project tags, an estimated difficulty, and if the user would like to be reminded about that task. On a main screen, the app would show a weekly view of which tasks need to be completed on which day (by due date) with a seperate box for tasks without a due date or a due date more than one week from the current date. Users would be able to filter by tag or location, and show only tasks relevant to their location or tag as they wish. The app could also recommend which task the user completes next by the due date and difficulty, as well as how long the task has been sitting on the list.

## Scope

Having taken Software Development last semester, I was able to get a good grasp on what kinds of projects succeed in a class like this. Even if just the features listed above are too much or too little for the class, I think that a project like this offers infinite opportunity for expansion or contraction by adding or removing app features. A to-do app can scale from a single HTML web-page offering checkboxes and an input textbox to a complete application with user authentication, sharing of data between users, a beautiful frontend, and lots of goodies for long-term use. With this kind of flexibility, it's near impossible to go wrong.
